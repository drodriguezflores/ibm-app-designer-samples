# Steps for Mortgage Approval sample

Synopsis
___
Cindy is a business developer in the mortgage department of a bank.  She wants to create an app for branch associates to use for opening mortgage accounts.  The app needs to gather customer information and mortgage details.  If the mortgage is automatically approved (low risk), it can be opened right away, otherwise the associate needs to leverage some charts to do an analysis and decide whether the account should be opened or not. 

Setup
___
To run this sample, you must have a Business Automation Workflow Center server running and connected to App Designer. If the workflow environment is properly configured then you should see a Workflow Services toolkit when opening BAStudio as an advanced user.

Prerequisite step: To run any of the scenarios, start by importing "MortgagePA - v7.twx" to the Workflow Center. This twx file contains a workflow process that will be leveraged by the Mortgage Approval app.

This sample has three main phases.  You may skip any phase and go directly to the scenario that you are interested in.
1. Import base artifacts then author the template artifacts as the provider.  These artifacts can be consumed by the app assembler. [See the Create Actions and Template folder.](./Create%20Actions%20and%20Template)
2. Author the Mortgage Approval app as an assembler.
   [See the "Create the Mortgage Approval App" folder.](./Create%20the%20Mortgage%20Approval%20App)
3. Publish the app and run it in Automation Navigator.
   [See the "Publish and Run" folder.](./Publish%20and%20Run)
